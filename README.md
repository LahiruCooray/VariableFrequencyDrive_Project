# VariableFrequencyDrive_Project
 Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) for AC motors play a pivotal role in modern industrial applications,
 offering precise control over motor speed and enhancing energy efficiency. These systems employ sophisticated 
 electronic circuits to regulate the frequency and voltage supplied to the motor, allowing for seamless
 adjustment of motor speed according to the application requirements
