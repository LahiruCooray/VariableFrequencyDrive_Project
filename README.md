# VariableFrequencyDrive_Project
## Overview
This repository contains the design and development files for the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) project. The VFD is designed to control the speed and torque of three-phase AC motors by varying the frequency and voltage supplied to the motor. This project includes detailed documentation, PCB designs, source code, and enclosure designs for building a functional VFD system capable of handling high currents up to 2.2 kW.
